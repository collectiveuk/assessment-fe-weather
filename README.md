# Collective Benefits Weather Technical Test

## Objective

Using the API Key, provided along with this test by the recruiter, use the OpenWeatherAPI [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api) to create a web app that allows a user to **input a location, such as 'London', and retrieve the current weather for that location**

_To do this you will need to make use of more than one endpoint_

You should make the interface presentable and stylish and you can use any style library you wish (ANTD, Material, etc.)

**The project also comes with Storybook which should be used.**

Finally, We would like to see at least **1** test written with react testing library.

Its not necessary but feel free to show off a little bit if you want to add some sizzle to your steak and have a cool idea!

Please contact us if you have any concerns or are experiencing issues whilst completing the challenge.

Have fun!
